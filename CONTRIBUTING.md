# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving `pulumi-tool-terraform-migrate`. This is a
Pulumi Professional Services tool for migrating Terraform (and, increasingly, AWS
CDK/CloudFormation) infrastructure into Pulumi via the standard `pulumi import`
workflow.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Go (the version pinned in [`go.mod`](./go.mod))
- [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run/) v2
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and the Pulumi CLI (for the integration tests)

Common tasks are wired up in the [`Makefile`](./Makefile):

```bash
make build      # compile the CLI to ./bin
make test       # run the Go test suite
make lint       # run golangci-lint
make fmt        # gofmt the tree
make check      # fmt-check + vet + lint (fast local gate)
```

## Tests

The suite mixes fast unit tests with heavier integration tests that download and
bridge real Pulumi providers and warm up OpenTofu. Those integration tests need
network access and a Pulumi access token, and some skip themselves when the
required infrastructure or credentials are absent. `make lint` and `make check`
need neither, so run those for a quick local signal.

## Pull requests

- Branch off `main`; do not commit directly to `main`.
- Keep PRs focused; write a clear description of the change and its motivation.
- Ensure `make check` passes and add tests for new behavior.
- CI runs lint, `go vet`, a gofmt check, `govulncheck`, and the Go test suite.
  All required checks must be green before merge.

## Branch protection

`main` is a protected branch. The recommended ruleset (applied by a repo admin —
see the commands in [the setup notes below](#applying-branch-protection)) is:

- Require a pull request before merging, with at least one approving review.
- Require the `lint`, `vet`, and `govulncheck` status checks to pass.
- Dismiss stale approvals on new pushes.
- Disallow force-pushes and direct pushes to `main`.

### Applying branch protection

A repository admin can apply the baseline with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh api -X PUT \
  repos/pulumi-proserv/pulumi-tool-terraform-migrate/branches/main/protection \
  --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["lint", "vet", "govulncheck"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON
```

Adjust the `contexts` to match the exact CI job names, and add
`"require_code_owner_reviews": true` only once [`CODEOWNERS`](./.github/CODEOWNERS)
lists a valid owner.
